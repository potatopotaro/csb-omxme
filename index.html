      Looking at the artwork, poetry, and music of African-Americans throughout
      the 19th and 20th century, we can understand the pain, struggle, and
      beauty of black history. Through the analysis and appreciation of the art
      that was derived from their creative souls and through connecting that art
      to historical events, the evolution of black culture and spirit is
      revealed, as we witness generations of black Americans find new meanings
      of freedom, equality, and strength.

    <div class="timePeriodTitle">The 19th Century</div>

    <div class="row summary">
      During the first half of the 19th century, the U.S. was divvying itself up
      into free and slave states, with events such as the Missouri compromise
      deciding the fates and freedoms of many African-Americans. During this
      time, black people were highly oppressed. The outcome of State v Mann
      rules that slave owners had complete control and authority of their
      slaves’ bodies, meaning they could be subject to unimaginable amounts of
      work and abuse. However John v. State rules that the killing of a white
      person by a slave was murder. The inequality of human rights, the lack of
      freedoms, and the outright abuse towards African-Americans led to many
      uprisings, including Nat Turner’s Rebellion, but they were to be defeated
      constantly. The Fugitive Slave Act entrapped slaved even more, with little
      possibility of relief in northern cities. In the north, however, the
      abolitionist movement was taking off, with figures such as Fredrick
      Douglass and black newspapers such as the Liberator and The North Star
      fueling the movement that was now stronger than ever. At this point,
      northern and southern blacks had very different struggles and existences.
      However it was still a time of survival and self-reliance for both. Riots
      in northern cities made many African-Americans flee to Canada. Among those
      who stayed, many united, meeting in church to worship, or at black
      conventions to discuss the future of the black community in terms of
      education, politics, and prosperity. For those who were enslaved, this was
      a time for survival of the body and soul, through family, fictive kin,
      religious awakening and both quiet and raging resistance.

            Grave of A Slave discusses death in a very interesting way, viewing
            death as a release instead of a cruel ending. As mentioned, the
            American government legally allowed the life and body of a slave to
            belong to their slave master. The torturous lives of many led slaves
            to see beyond their physical existence on earth. The poem mentions
            ideas such as safety, freedom, and rest—all rights that slaves did
            not possess, however they could theoretically claim these rights
            after death. Forten also refers to the grave as a place where “rich
            and poor find a permanent home”. Death was a destinantion in which,
            slaves could finally reach an equal status. Neither slave or slave
            master could avoid death. A slave was always accesible to their
            master, and with the fugitive slave act, there was almost no way of
            escape. Forten’s line “Not his master can rouse him with voice of
            command; He knows not and hears not his cruel demand;” reveals a
            slaves longing to escape constant work and cruelty. They could
            worship and pray, marry, have children, sing, and dance to soothe
            their souls but death could be seen as a final release. Soul death
            on Earth, by giving into hopelessness and despair was to be avoided,
            but death was to be accepted. Freedom was to come soon from
            emancipation after the Civil War, but for slaves before that time,
            the only way to reach freedom was by death.

        James Whitfield’s America passionately addresses the hypocrisy of the
        United States. He questions a nation of freedom, liberty, and justices
        that wrongs so many. The poem bases itself on the fact that
        African-Americans fought for America’s freedom and democracy during the
        Revolutionary War alongside white Americans only to maintain their
        status as slaves and as highly oppressed people with no freedom or
        democracy. They fought for the soil, but it was not theirs in the end,
        which makes us question “Who does America belong to?”. Whitfield grazes
        the idea of natural or birth rights that becomes more of a discussion
        during reconstruction but is relevant at this time to the moral validity
        of the institution of slavery. His poem is not quiet, it holds a
        determined and angry voice that promises black prosperity to
        African-Americans and relentless pursuit of this to the oppressor. He
        also calls for justice to all black people in all parts of the United
        States. This is important to mention because of the differences in
        status and welfare that black people had in the north and south, and in
        free and slave states. What they needed to achieve differed greatly,
        from autonomy of the body to economic, educational, and political
        prosperity.

          Born a slave in Georgia, Harriett Powers started creating quilts after
          she was emancipated. Powers’ inclusion of both biblical stories and
          real-life tales, reflect both the slave experience and the religious
          awakening of slaves. In her quilt work, simple depictions of people
          and animals are visible. In one panel, there appears to be a figure
          lying on the ground among animals, under a flying whip in a persons’
          hand. This illustrates the abuse that slaves were forced to endure due
          to the permission granted by the ruling of cases such as State v.
          Mann. Many were abused physically, verbally, and emotionally. Women
          were often victims of sexual assault, with no escape from the white
          men who claimed to own them. Because of this trauma, the idea of soul
          values is very relevant. The legal and social theft of slaves’
          identity, value, freedom, and control, forced them to save their souls
          instead. Many turned towards religion to help guide their souls to
          relief, often seeing death as an escape from the trauma that bodies
          held. Harriett Powers depicts not only scenes of trauma, but also of
          peace. Her images of people in worship and marriage are proof of
          passive resistance that maintained the soul during slavery.

    <div class="row summary">
      After emancipation, African-Americans had a long road ahead of them to
      freedom. Reconstruction was to mend the nation, without consideration to
      the welfare of African-Americans. While Civil Rights acts gave them new
      liberties, and while organizations such as the Freedmen's bureau attempted
      to help the black community, they were still walked all over. The failure
      of land reform and the difficulty of climbing the economic ladder out from
      the depths of slavery kept the majority of African-Americans in
      devastating poverty. Many became share-croppers or became entrapped in the
      shackles of peonage, both abstractions of the institution of slavery.
      White supremacy still reigned in the south, with groups such as the Ku
      Klux Klan keeping black people in a constant state of fear. The ruling of
      Plessy v. Ferguson allowed for separate but equal laws, claiming that
      segregation did not infringe on the equality of citizens. This was the
      start of the Jim Crow era, which would keep black people at an unequal
      status to whites for years to come.

          Lift Every Voice and Sing is an example of religion once again being a
          theme of African-American resistance. Black Americans turned towards
          God to guide them and give them hope during the era of slavery however
          even after emancipation, freedom songs were used to lift the spirit in
          order to achieve true deserved equality and freedom. This expresses
          how emancipation was not freedom but really only a step towards it.
          God is always tied to these ideas of liberty, freedom, and victory
          which reveals the differences in faith and Christianity between whites
          and blacks as well as what inspired their worship. The song references
          themes of darkness and hopelessness and juxtaposes them with the light
          of God, communicating the importance of faith in obtaining peace and
          equality to black people at this time. The “gloomy past” that it
          refers to is slavery and the “bright star” is the future they hope
          for. The song closes with a repetition of the phrase our “native land”
          as if to convince and remind themselves over and over that America
          does in fact and should belong to them. This is proof of the creation
          of the African-American identity. Black people were brought to America
          as property. They went from foreigners to citizens on their native
          land on which they should claim their rights and liberties.

        Stuck in the cage of institutionalized and societally ingrained racism,
        the nadir was a dark time for African-Americans. Despite the weight of
        inequality and fear of racism, they found ways to uplift themselves.
        During this time, great civil rights activists came to stage, such as
        Booker T Washington and WEB Dubois. This was also the start of the

          In 1913, Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller created the work, Emancipation,
          which still stands today at Harriet Tubman park, in Boston, MA. The
          piece was created in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the
          emancipation proclamation. The statue depicts a man and woman emerging
          from the tree of life, and is in itself a symbol of progress and
          strength for African-Americans, proof that they were no longer
          enslaved. Many of Fuller's other sculptures follow a theme of horror
          and pain however. Mother and Child and the Wretched both express
          emotions of grief or heartache. Although her works uplift black
          people, they also highlight the pain and reality of the black
          experience, especially during such low times. Although they were out
          of slavery, as represented in Emancipation, they were still hurting.
          Mother and child expresses the feeling of needing to protect the
          youth. African-Americans were in fear for themselves and for their
          children because of the turbulent and racist world they lived in.
          White supremist aggression, police brutality, and lynching were real
          threats that they could do little to protect themselves from.

          The Negro Speak rivers captures the passing of the black experience
          from generation to generation. Hughs writes from first person but
          speaks from the perspective of the “negro”. He references rivers in
          different geographical locations that shift through time from the
          Euphrates and the Congo to the Mississippi River. This symbolizes the
          long and painful history of African-Americans, from the theft of their
          home and transportation of their bodies through the Middle Passage, to
          the planting of their roots in southern American soil. Hughs uses this
          metaphor of rivers to represent the connection of black people in
          their history and their black experience. He illustrates the passing
          of this shared trauma in a landform and uses it to express how it has
          affected the soul of himself and every other black American. He
          describes it as deep and well-known. Like many other African-American
          artists, while addressing pain, he also speaks of beauty and hope,
          mentioning Lincoln to reference emancipation and “the muddy blossom”
          turning “golden in the sunset” as an illustration of the beauty that
          has always been created and seen through all the heartache of black
          history.

          To a Dark Girl is a recognition of the pain of black history and
          enslavement as well as a call to move forward. It is also significant
          in that it was created by and for a black woman. One must think about
          the different experiences between genders when talking about race, and
          Bennett was a voice that protected not only black people but black
          women. Black female bodies have a history of neglect and abuse, as
          well as a history of unrecognized beauty or femininity because of
          their position as second class citizens, laborers, and servants. In
          this poem, Bennett is lifting them out of these positions and
          recognizing their beauty for all that it is. Commonly black features
          such as dark skin and full lips had been shamed and mocked in pop
          culture in the past. Brooks however illustrates these features in a
          light of beauty, creating a sense of black pride and celebration of
          black beauty. Artists from the Harlem renaissance, such as Gwendolyn
          Brooks were proof of the social, cultural, artistic, and communal
          prosperity that was possible in northern cities, promoting the

            Black and Blue reflects the frustration of being discriminated
            against in America based on skin color. The song was originally
            written by Fats Waller and Andy Razaf but was covered by Louis
            Armstrong in 1929. Most of the lyrics are the same, however the
            original version opens from a woman’s perspective, ranting about the
            consequences of the darkness of her skin in her relationships with
            people. The song reads.

            The rest of the song continues the same, however this part of the
            original song speaks upon a different part of blackness—colorism
            within the black community. The weight of white beauty standards
            created superiority around light skin that often left darker
            African-Americans under more scrutiny and discrimination from both
            whites and fellow blacks. Armstrong leaves out this part, but still
            the song addresses frustration with the relationship between skin
            color and social status. Armstrong however focused more upon this
            difference between whites and African-Americans in general. He often
            worked with white people and for white audiences which he was
            sometimes scrutinized for, as he was seen as an elitist perhaps and
            a traitor of his community. He took this position however and used
            it to often display not only his talent as a black artist but also
            the struggles that came with his identity as a black man. Armstrong
            was an incredibly important and influential artist during his time,
            later even being named the cultural ambassador of the US during the
            Cold War. He addresses his closeness to the white community in the
            line “I’m white inside, it don’t help my case ‘Cause I can’t hide
            what’s in my face”. This reveals the common phenomenon of the white
            community’s willingness to accept black people as entertainers but
            not as people. This theme of invisibility is discussed in the novel
            Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison which discusses issues of identity
            and social status as an African-American during the early 20th
            century. Ellison mentions Louis Armstrong as well as his rendition
            of What did I do to be so Black and Blue in his novel. It reads,

          Augusta Savage created Lift Every Voice and Sing, also known as The
          Harp in 1939. It was based off of the song that was declared the
          “National Negro Anthem” by the NAACP in 1919. It represents the unity
          of the African-American community against the odds of
          institutionalized racism in America during that time. It is a symbol
          of strength and harmony and is telling of the importance of music to
          the movement of black upliftment, whether in the church or in protest.
          It promotes the unification of the black community with the inclusion

          Aaron Douglass was born in Topeka, Kansas in 1899. Growing up in the
          midst of southern segregation inspired many pieces throughout the
          1930s that spoke to the fight for black equality, often depicting
          African Americans as warriors. The figures are almost always
          silhouettes gathered together in different layers and transparencies
          of color. Douglass often combines imagery of African vegetation and
          aesthetics with more modern scenes from the Harlem Renaissance
          including what appears to be a jazz club in Charleston. Although the
          figures are simple and unidentifiable, the strong movement and emotion
          of their poses communicate the call to either fight or dance. Douglass
          also includes religious symbols such as crosses or angel wings. The
          collection of symbols from African roots, southern culture, jazz
          culture, and Christianity seamlessly connect the variety of aspects
          that create the black community.

          Billie Holiday’s infamous Strange Fruit confronts the bitterness of
          southern racism, describing the common atrocity of lynching in poetic
          verse. While Holiday mainly created soothing jazz songs about themes
          of love, this song was an ode to the undeniable frustration and
          protest of hatred and violence towards black people. Her use of
          extended metaphor is unsettling and haunting. This juxtsiposition of
          nature and fruit baring trees with dead hanging black bodies speaks to
          the cruelty of lynching and the horror of the normalization of it.
          Lynchings were often celebrated, with white folks gathered to watched
          and take pictures of the murder while police stood in the sidelines.
          Her directness about the climate of fear in the south speaks to the
          deeply rooted racism there that caused many black people to migrate
          out of the South in search of safety and opportunity.

          Horace Pippin was born in 1888 in West Chester, Pennsylvania. He
          served in World War l as a young man in an all-black unit called the
          Harlem Hellfighters, which faced copious amounts of racist
          discrimination. He took up painting soon after he was discharged due
          to injury, usually recreating scenes of war. He said later, “the war
          brought all the art out of me”. He also created images of past times,
          such as The Hanging of John Brown and the Trial of John Brown which
          were both odes to the martyr of the African-American cause. He painted
          scenes of the black American south, often depicting shacks and
          cottages in fields of cotton. He later shifted to painting scenes of
          northern black domestic life.They illustrate the modest homes of black
          families and usually include a maternal figure taking care of
          something, bathing a child, serving a meal. This gives credit to the
          black family unit and to the laborious work of black women during the
          impoverished times of the Great Depression. One very strong and
          symbolic piece is Mr. Prejudice, painted in 1943. In this work, Pippin
          is creating a complex discussion about racism in America. Unreasonable
          discrimination was made clear to him after serving in the war only to
          return to a segregated and racist America. The painting is packed with
          figures of opposing sides of racial tension all together. The piece
          itself is split in two by a white man with an ax, cracking the middle
          of the letter “V” for victory and splitting the piece into two sides,
          black and white. Back to back, at the point of the breaking “V”, are
          two machinists, one black and one white. This is reflective of the
          industrial wartime era, in which black people contributed but still
          faced discrimination. The bottom of the piece is split up into black
          and white wartime soldiers on either side, with Pippin in the middle
          staring at the viewer with his lame right arm. After living through
          another world war, Pippin is addressing the apparent racism and
          segregation of whites and blacks during a time which should promote
          national unity. While the painting is mainly split between a clear
          vertical line, there are chilling diagonal relationships, with a white
          cloaked KKK member in the upper right corner and a white cloaked
          perhaps bandaged and injured black soldier or nurse in the bottom
          left. Next to the KKK member is a white man with a noose held in his
          hand, threateningly staring at the Statue of Liberty which has been
          purposely discolored to claim a black identity. The items in their
          hands create a struggle, with a noose symbolizing violence and racism
          and the torch symbolizing liberty and justice for all. This haunting
          juxtaposition saturates the climate of racism and injustice during
          this time, addressing the hypocrisy of black wartime effort being
          rewarded with lynchings and a constant state of fear and
          discrimination.

        <div class="column analysis">
          William Johnson was born into poverty in South Carolina and moved to
          New York at the age of seventeen. He married a Danish artist and lived
          in Scandinavia for many years which gave him a strong folk art
          influence. He returned to Harlem, New York in 1938 where he created
          the majority of his work. His dynamic and colorful paintings depict
          scenes of southern life, Harlem life, migration, important historical
          and political events, as well as scenes of police brutality, lynching,
          and overall racially motivated violence. Johnson addresses the issue
          of peonage in a painting titled Chain Gang, which depicts three black
          men in striped jumpsuits toiling the soil. This institution kept
          thousands of African-Americans essentially enslaved as they were
          forced to do vigorous physical labor because they had committed a
          crime or needed to pay off debt. Many fell into debt because of the
          system of sharecropping or were convicted for small misdemeanors, but
          the punishment was all the same. Men, women, and children could be
          held in bondage, sometimes kept wrongfully, long over their sentence.
          Prisoners were often abused and made to work unimaginably long hours
          of harsh physical labor. This was also the start of mass incarceration
          in the US of African-Americans that would continue into the present
          day. Johnson also painted scenes of southern black life, revealing the
          reality of impoverished rural existence. Some paintings depict
          baptisms and visits to church, which maintain our understanding of the
          importance of religion to the black community during this time. He
          also painted young black men leaving for the war, or lined up in their
          segregated military squads. These paintings often have an American
          flag somewhere in the composition, probably as a subtle remark towards
          the idea of American nationalism and the hypocrisy of American values
          to the reality of the black experience. The flag of a wealthy and a
          free nation juxtaposes the shack that the family stands outside of as
          they wave goodbye to a young man going off to war. Johnson painted
          many historically relevant pieces, including scenes from World War ll,
          the Tehran conference, as well events from before his time such as the
          hanging of Nat Turner. His painting Nat Turner hanging includes
          numerous graves in the background., which gives messages of the mass
          murder of black people. This is also exemplified in the piece titled
          Let My People Free, in which Fredrick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln
          stand idly in meeting between a piece of paper that perhaps represents
          the Emancipation Proclamation. Behind them are numerous black men
          being hung, as if to say emancipation meant nothing. He also created a
          piece in honor of the Underground Railroad and in honor of Harriet
          Tubman’s efforts. This movement of black people is seen again in his
          paintings about The Great Migration, with images of African-Americans
          fleeing the south, their belongings in tow, to escape the
          discrimination and lack of opportunity in the south. There is a shift
          in content as we see images of Harlem, and the great artistic culture
          that was growing there. He painted men and women in fashionable attire
          standing in the streets of Harlem, playing music, and dancing. This is
          a reflection of the bustling artistic movement that was taking place
          around him. One painting stands out however, titled “Moon Over
          Harlem”. It is a confusing piece that was most likely inspired by the
          riots that broke out during the summer of ‘43 in Harlem due to police
          brutality towards African-Americans. It looks violent at first but
          upon closer inspection, one can see that it depicts the aftermath of
          the riots, with black people collecting themselves in some world where
          all the police officers are black, picking up their limbs and pieces,
          lifting them off the ground littered with liquor bottles and carrying
          them away. Overall however, this piece exposes the racial tension
          prevalent in northern cities. While Johnson painted scenes of people
          dancing and playing music happily in Harlem he also painted the other
          reality. Through his work, he illustrated southern disparity,
          migration to a northern paradise, as well as the truth of that
          northern paradise, which is that it is still racist and
          discriminatory. African-Americans were still in poverty, still
          politically disenfranchised, and still oppressed.

          Jacob Lawrence was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey to Southern
          migrant parents. In 1930, he moved to Harlem with his mother and
          sister. As a child, Lawrence became interested in art through an after
          school program for art and crafts. Once he became a teenager, he began
          painting primarily on his own. Going through adolescence during the
          Great Depression, Lawrence and his family fell on hard times. He
          dropped out of high school to support his family and enrolled in the
          Civilian Conservation Corps, a New Deal program. Later on however,
          through the WPA (Works Progress Administration) Federal Art Project,
          also a part of the New deal, Lawrence was finally able to start his
          career as an artist. Many of his series are about important
          African-American figures such as Fredrick Douglass and Harriet Tubman.
          He is most famous however for his series titled the Migration of the
          Negro, a sixty panel series which illustrates scenes from the Great
          Migration. With a very limited color palette, these pieces depict
          scenes of numerous black people and families in coats and hats,
          luggage in hand, leaving for northern cities. The exaggerated density
          of traffic is perhaps used to communicate the great numbers of black
          people that migrated during this time. In one panel, there is a crowd
          of people rushing through their choice of three doors labeled Chicago,
          New York, and St. Louis, all hotspots for African-Americans during
          that time to meet family, find work, and search for rest. The large
          crowds and somehow rapid movement of these still pieces give the
          viewer a sense of urgency, desperation, and determination. Lawrence
          created a variety of artworks about the black community, including
          many about urban life. Some are rather upbeat, showing the bustling
          black communities in northern cities as depicted in Brownstones. A
          darker illustration however, titled Tombstones, made in 1942, is a
          chilling drawing of a building front with a variety of characters.
          Through the open windows, people lean out to look down at people on
          the steps including a seemingly tired woman slumped over in thought. A
          distressed looking mother clutches a baby in her hands on the sidewalk
          where a child in a stroller sits by themselves reaching for a doll
          that has fallen to the ground. The doll is white of course with blonde
          hair. This all takes place in front of a store selling tombstones
          outside of it. The piece reveals a sorrowful narrative about life for
          black people in northern urban communities. The interruption of daily
          life with the insertion of characters that appear to be in despair
          creates a serious tone. They are not involved with each other which
          makes it understood that this feeling of sadness is overarching and
          not contained to the individual. The casual location of a tombstone
          store sets a dark tone to the piece. It creates the idea that black
          people were always close to death and caught in a difficult existence
          of never winning. They faced wartime, poverty, police brutality, and
          constant discrimination that did not allow them to be safe. They lived
          in a society that did not care about their welfare, and so they
          casually sat by death, waiting to claim their tombstone. And the child
          reaches for the doll, symbolizing African-Americans' distance from
          privilege, as well as their desire to obtain the freedom and security
          of whiteness. Lawrence was an incredibly important artist who allowed
          the lives, loves, and struggles of African-Americans to be recognized.
          He once said about his work, “If at times my productions do not
          express the conventionally beautiful, there is always an effort to
          express the universal beauty of man’s continuous struggle to lift his
          social position and to add dimension to his spiritual being.”

          consistent with the work of the TGP’s most accomplished printmakers.
          These include images of working women, urban laborers and campesinos,
          children working and caring for smaller children, homeless children in
          the city, and indigenous children in the country; and African American
          mothers, workers, ordinary people, and historical heroines. In
          Sharecropper, initially a black-and-white linoleum cut of the early
          1950s (some early proofs also include experiments with color), subtly
          varied, closely spaced hatchings demarcating contour, pattern,
          material, and texture reflect the fluency she developed as a
          printmaker at the TGP. Characteristic of her portrayal of strong,
          dignified black women, the expressionistic angularity of the woman’s
          careworn face and the monumentality of the image’s compositional focus
          are emblematic of the respect Catlett felt her subject deserved.

          Gordon Parks was an artist, photographer, author, and filmmaker who
          created his work with a strong drive for social activism. Born in
          Fort, Kansas, Parks grew up in poverty and segregation. As a young man
          he became interested in photography and managed to buy a camera from a
          pawn shop, with which he taught himself to photograph. Parks said, “I
          saw that the camera could be a weapon against poverty, against racism,
          against all sorts of social wrongs. I knew at that point I had to have
          a camera.” His talent and vision brought him far, and he eventually
          started working professionally. Parks is well known for his stunning
          capture of the effects of poverty and racism within urban communities.
          One of his more well-known photos is titled Emerging Man, which
          depicts a young black man cautiously emerging from the ground with a
          manhole cover lifted above his head. The photo was part of a
          photo-essay titled A Man Becomes Invisible which was inspired by none
          other than Ralph Ellison and his novel Invisible Man which was
          mentioned earlier. This theme of invisibility has survived and is
          still very relevant to the existence of African-Americans. The work is
          a commentary on the social status of African-Americans as second-class
          citizens. Under Jim Crow, they were given significantly worse
          facilities and institutions. They were continually politically
          disenfranchised and many were in economic disparity. In fear of white
          supermicist attack or police brutality they were made to be quiet. An
          idea often addressed in Ellison’s novel Invisible Man is loss of
          identity and the physiological impact of constant racism and
          discrimination. Often in history, a group of oppressed people can
          become clumped together so we understand their struggle as it affects
          their community as whole, however the impact of racism deeply injured
          the soul, spirit, brain, and worth of the individual because they were
          constantly treated as less. Another famous image of Parks is American
          Gothic which is a play off of the well-known painting American Gothic
          created by Grant Wood. Parks replaces the elderly white farmer couple
          holding a pitchfork in front of a farmhouse with a singular middle
          aged black woman holding a broom and a mop in front of an American
          flag. This photo makes commentary on the reality of who works and
          maintains America which is often lower or middle-class people of
          color. The blank expression of the woman creates a tone of tiredness.
          Black people built the country as slaves and continues to maintain it
          for no credit. American Gothic blurs the loud boastful American flag
          in the background and instead focuses on the main character, who was a
          real mother and working woman. The 1950s brought new civil rights to
          African-Americans, with Brown v. Board of Education ruling the
          segregation of schools unconstitutional. This case was a step towards
          equality for African-Americans and finally revealed injustice in the
          flawed claims of “separate but equal” facilities. With black and white
          children allowed to attend the same schools, this also meant progress
          towards equal education. Racism still reigned however, with murders
          such as of Emmett Till reminding black people that they were not
          wanted and not safe. Racial violence like this disenfranchised many
          African-Americans, keeping them quiet and away from the voting booth.

          Clementine Hunter was born in Natchitoches, Louisiana and lived and
          worked on the Melrose cotton plantation for most of her life. She
          didn’t start painting until her later years and could only paint
          during her free time at night after working all day. She worked on any
          surface she could find, including canvas, wood, gourds, paper, wine
          bottles, iron pots, cutting boards, and milk jugs. Her paintings were
          almost always created from memory and depicted her daily life with
          images such as cotton fields, baptisms, and funerals being common. Her
          lack of professional training makes her illustrations of southern
          African-American life very genuine and heartfelt, because she was
          simply painting her surroundings. Through her artwork we can see how
          life in the south had maintained its loyalty to the cotton industry
          and how the physical work was still the same. Her depiction of black
          mothers helps us understand the crucial and difficult position they
          had in order to maintain the home. The importance of religion has
          remained, but we can now see that in the years since slavery it has
          become the bustling center of the black community. In the depths of
          slavery, spirituality was a quiet savior, and while it was unchanged
          in the way that it promoted and maintained hope and perseverence, it
          is at this time a center for social gathering, protection, and
          philanthropy.

    <div class="timePeriodTitle">1960s</div>
    <div class="row summary">
      The 1960s was a powerful time for the Civil Rights movement, with strong
      figures such Martin Luther King Junior and Malcom X leading
      African-Americans to rise up. Movements such as the Montgomery bus boycott
      and groups such as the Freedom Riders also brought success, with Browder v
      Gayle finally ruling racial segregation in public transportation illegal
      in 1956. The March on Washington also took place during this era. The
      event gathered thousands of people in an effort to demand equality, and it
      had some success, with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 passing the very next
      year. This ended segregation in America, outlawing discrimination based on
      race, color, gender, religion, or nationality. Voter registration at this
      time had been a very pressing issue in southern states for a long time.
      Due to the threatening and racist climate in the south, many
      African-Americans refrained from voting. This was helped by projects such
      as the Mississippi Freedom Summer project and by the tireless work of
      people like Anne Moody and other activists who helped to promote black
      voter registration in the south despite the threats of violence that were
      inflicted upon them. The Black Panthers also emerged during this time, a
      group which fought against racial discrimination and police brutality
      while also promoting black pride and upliftment. Many considered the Black
      Panthers to be too radical, but many supported their proactive activism
      and “self-help” approach of protecting black lives. While the civil rights
      movement splintered into factions of varying intensity, overall the era it
      claimed was a time of progress, black power, and a demand for change that
      struggled through unrelenting racism.

      Music has always been an important aspect of the black community, from
      work songs in times of slavery, to gospel songs in church, to the
      revolutionary movement of jazz. During black rallies and marches, freedom
      songs were almost always sung. They acted almost as a prayer and a
      reminder of strength and unity during the darkest of times. The same
      infamous songs were often sung at these gatherings, well known by their
      performers. By looking at the lyrics of these pieces we can understand the
      deep seeded pain of the black experience as well as the hopefulness that
      was maintained in effort to achieve equality.

          One of the most famous anthems of the movement for black equality was
          We Shall Overcome. The repetitive nature of the lyrics makes it feel
          like an inner monolog, a prayer, or a hymn. The song serves as a
          reassurance that change will come and that peace is not only possible
          but that it shall happen. It is a positive song of upliftment and
          inspiration. Although it says “We are not afraid” over and over, it is
          sadly very telling of the threatening climate that black people had to
          overcome.

          A Change is Gonna Come is also a song of positivity that affirms a
          bright future for the black community. However while We Shall Overcome
          focuses on a fixed positive message and looks towards the future, this
          song lingers on the current pains of the black experience, then
          returns to the certainty of change. The first stanza talks about the
          familiarity of running. This is reflective of African-Americans’
          denial of safety and security in their homeland. Oppression has kept
          them running, away from slavery, away from violence, away to the north
          in search of safety and opportunity. The relationship between death
          and the difficulty of existence is also created, expressing the
          reality of black struggle. While segregation was banned with the Civil
          Rights Act of 1964, racial discrimination was still very apparent as
          told in the stanza which says “I go to the movie. And I go downtown.
          Somebody keep telling me don’t hang around.” The idea of black
          disunity is also referenced in the lines which read,”Then I go to my
          brother and I say, brother, help me please. But he winds up, knockin’
          me down on my knees.” This expresses the issue of black people
          avoiding confrontation out of fear perhaps, jadedness, or something
          else. But the song ends on a positive note, once again reassuring that
          change will come.

          Nina Simone’s Mississippi Goddam addresses the oppressively racist and
          violent atmosphere of the south that the whole nation was aware of.
          The song was made out of frustration for the injustices that had been
          inflicted upon black people. The line “I think every day’s gonna be my
          last '' expresses the state of constant fear that southern black
          people lived in, with the KKK still active as well as a general
          culture of racism. The line “School children sitting in jail”
          expresses the difficulty of being an activist in the south, many of
          which were young individuals and students. Fear of death and jail kept
          black southerners disenfranchised and oppressed. Prayer is also
          questioned by Simone, which reflects the shifting attitude of black
          activists who were tired of passiveness, and perhaps did not see God
          as their savior anymore because of years of pain and oppression. Not
          only is religion questioned but also the idea of conformity. Years of
          scrutiny had many African-Americans up until now under the impression
          that perhaps if they worked to rise to the level of white living and
          scrubbed themselves of blackness they could be treated equally. This
          respect and equality was never given however and was never intended to
          be given. Simone also rants about the rate at which change was
          happening by creating a parallel between white people demanding
          efficiency from the work of black people and black people demanding
          efficiency in the changing of policy and society. Overall Mississippi
          Goddam is about frustration with rampant southern racism and the
          enabling political idleness that everyone was aware of.

          Four women describes four different women of varying skin tones as
          well as the treatment they receive for their uncontrollable outward
          appearances. The First Lady, with black skin, speaks of her strength
          or the expectation of her strength and her ability to withstand pain
          “again and again”. This expresses the history of black women
          especially with darker skin being denied gentle treatment that would
          otherwise be received if it weren’t for their denial of femininity.
          Black women’s femininity was only acknowledged by whites when they
          were seen as sexual objects by their white slave masters or by the
          white men they worked for later on. Outside of that, their womanhood
          was not recognized and they were expected to work as hard as a man,
          not left out of slavery, peonage, or any harsh labor. The dark skinned
          woman is also called Aunt Sarah, giving her an identity of perhaps an
          older lady or a caretaker instead of simply a woman. The second woman
          has yellow skin. She addresses the difficult position that mixed race
          individuals were in, as they could not be fully accepted by either
          race. She also mentions her conceivement which was by the rape of her
          black mother by the rich white man she probably worked for. This
          speaks to the accessibility of black women by white men while working
          in their homes where they could do little to protect themselves. The
          third woman, with tan skin, is seen as attractive because of her
          lighter skin and is seen as a sexual object which is apparent in what
          they call her, Sweet Thing. The final woman with brown skin speaks of
          the difficulty of her life due to her skin color. She has felt the
          pain of racism which has been passed down from parents’ life as
          slaves. Simone brings to light the very important issue of colorism in
          the discussion of race, recognizing that the shades of a black
          peoples’ skin will give them varying experiences of racism. This is
          also very relevant during a time of black pride, when
          African-Americans were embracing their blackness and expressing their
          beauty. Four Women marries the two experiences of being a woman and
          being black to address the complexity of this identity. Simone is
          creating a discussion about black femininity, analyzing its
          intricacies in order to bring pride to the black female identity.

          Otis Redding’s Sittin on the Dock of The Bay is a song about
          migration. Redding explains his departure from Georgia in order to
          settle in San Francisco because of the lack of opportunity in the
          South for black people. The “two thousand miles” he roamed is a
          reflection of the desperate measures African-Americans were willing to
          take in order to join the Great Migration. Redding’s lyrics take on a
          tone of apathy because “nothings gonna change” and “everything still
          still remains the same”. This expresses the feelings of discontentment
          within the black community because of continuous neglect and

          freedom song created by Nina Simone. The song has a simple yet strong

          for all black people. Her choice of phrasing, saying that she wishes
          she knew how it would feel to be free expresses how this right has
          never been known to black people because they have never truly been
          free in America, even after emancipation. This is proof from the
          individual that they are not free because they have never felt free,
          despite society telling them that they are. This is a reflection of
          the technical equality given to black people by law that does not

          Say it Loud I’m Black and I’m Proud, sung by James Brown, is an anthem
          of black pride and a representation of the frustration from years of
          oppression that fueled black civil rights activists to shift to a more
          assertive approach in their demands for equality. Many freedom songs
          during this time took on this tone of frustration, similar to that of
          Nina Simone’s Mississippi Goddam. Brown opens with the fact that any
          form of black assertiveness is often demonized and viewed as
          aggression or malice. He defends black rebels and promises that they
          will not cease until they have the rights they deserve. The song acts
          as a breaking point, laying out all of the torture of African-American
          history due to their work for the white man and demanding justice for
          how they were wronged. This is once again a reflection of the new wave
          black liberation movement during the 1960s in which black people took
          pride in their strength and their history and shaped their anger into
          demands for peace. Looking back through history this is a dramatic
          shift from black peoples rightfully passive resistance during
          enslavement. The chorus of the song “Say it loud: I’m black and I’m
          proud” is repeated throughout the song and is a reflection of the
          large black power movement that was taking shape during the 1960s.
          This culture encouraged blackness to be not just recognized and
          accepted but embraced and celebrated.

          Barkley L Hendricks was an artist from Philadelphia who focused
          primarily on creating portraits of African-Americans. He used his
          artwork to portray the black subject in a light of elegance and
          strength. His portraits usually depicted African-Americans with their
          natural hair, in very stylish clothing from the 60s and 70s. His
          paintings serve as an upliftment of the black individual, making them
          the sole subject of the painting with no distraction.

          Maya Angelou’s Still I Rise is a powerful literary work that directs
          it’s clever attitude towards a white audience. Angelou confronts her
          reader with uncomfortable questions about their perception of her
          black identity, laying out the thoughts of her oppressor. The poem
          functions in an interesting way in that it makes self-derogatory
          comments, but takes control of these comments to uplift herself. She
          makes their judgment and their hatred her power. This work is also
          very important in that it speaks to the experience of the black woman.
          Angelou uses the scrutinized characteristics of her black female
          identity to her advantage, weaponizing her sass and confronting the
          reader with the boastful acceptance of her femininity and sexiness.
          She embraces the history of her black identity, connecting the past of
          slavery to her powerful existence today. Angelou is defiant in her
          words. She is telling her audience that the oppressed are strong and
          will always overcome their oppressor. That no matter the hatred and
          violence inflicted upon them, they will rise above. This tone of
          assertiveness is representative of new wave black pride once again.
          Angelou expresses pride in herself communicates her anger with grace,
          power, and light-heartedness. This is symbolic of the strength and
          beauty of her identity and represents the collective black feminine
          experience.

          In her poem, Who Said It Was Simple, Audre Lorde addresses the dilemma
          of bearing the weight of two different oppressions which form her
          struggle as a black woman. Lorde opens her poem with a metaphor for
          anger and the way it splits and fractures because there are too many
          things to be angry about. With a very short story in the middle, Lorde
          addresses the separation between black struggle and female struggle
          and how they do not understand one another or recognize the others’
          oppression. Lorde claims her ability to see both sides because of her
          existence as a black woman, knowing that there is struggle in both
          identities. She closes her short poem in wonder, now referencing
          herself as two different people, and confused as to how she can
          survive with two identities that do not understand each other. This
          simple, concise poem so accurately describes the issue of being a
          women of color, especially at a more discriminatory time in American
          history. While race and gender bring different struggles, you cannot
          separate the two when they are both a part of someone’s identity. How
          these two parts interact with one another is very relevant to the
          existence of a person. As seen throughout history, black women were
          confronted with the threat of both white people and men. To take one
          of these away is denying that being a black woman is a valid
          existence, or else she is always the other. The other race and the
          other gender.

          Audre Lorde’s Power, written in 1978, is a chilling piece of
          literature based on the murder of a ten-year-old black boy by a white
          police officer. The graphic descriptions of police brutality and the
          violence of white power leave a feeling of sickness within the reader.
          Her intense descriptions are meant to strike the reader and confront
          them with the reality of senseless violence and descrimination towards
          black people that kills the innocent. In her gory description of being
          beside the dead child, she describes the vast white desert in which
          she is lost. This metaphor expresses how white power dominated the
          criminal justice system and beyond, creating a doomed feeling of being
          lost in all the lies and injustice. In the third stanza, the police
          officer who shot the little boy says, “I didn’t notice the size nor
          nothing else only the color”. This quote reflects the blind cruelty of
          a racist brain as well as the adultification or even dehumanization of
          black youth who are commonly discriminated against and targeted by
          police. Lorde carries themes of power throughout the poem, bringing up
          again her opening remarks about the difference between poetry and
          rhetoric in regards to use of power. Lorde is trying to express how
          poetry can be used to summon important intensities, soothe the soul,
          and tell the truth while the rhetoric of police reports and courtroom
          documents can be used to cover up injustice in the hands of the evil
          and powerful. Lorde is perhaps trying to communicate the importance of
          her practice as a poet to the application of her power and her moral
          responsibility. Power overall tells a story of racially motivated
          murder and the failures of every part of the criminal justice system
          due to the grip of white power and intimidation, as well as the
          collective failure to “our children”. It is a reflection of
          institutionalized racism that would senselessly kill or incarcerate
          mass amounts of black people in America.

      TODO: ERIKA FIGURE THIS OUT <br />
      The start of the new decade welcomed Reagan into office in 1980. Through
      the Reagan administration, The War on Drugs took off, with the
      Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 changing America's system for
      dealing with drug use from a rehabilitation system to a punitive system
      that supported the industry of for-profit-prisons. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act
      of 1988 also made the buying, selling, and possession of drugs including
      marijuana illegal as well as set mandatory minimum sentences for drug
      crimes. While these laws were already harmful at their most basic level,
      the details of their execution would be found to extremely discriminatory
      towards black people. With a changing economy that excluded many people
      from white collar jobs, and the appearance of a new inexpensive drug,
      crack cocaine, many African-Americans turned to doing or selling crack to
      soothe and escape the pains of poverty. This of course led to the mass
      incarceration of mainly black men, leaving nearly half of all
      African-American families as single mother households, which kept them
      deep in poverty. Because of the new drug trade in urban African-American
      communities, crime rates were very high which led to increased police
      surveillance which then led to racial tension and police brutality. In all
      of this, the black was still growing and changing, with hip-hop culture on
      it’s way up.

          Basquiat was born in 1960 in Brooklyn, New York. Due to his mothers
          efforts, he grew up with a strong appreciation for the arts and
          started making his own work as a graffiti artist in the lower east
          side. He was discovered a little while later, during the late 80s,
          when his career took off as an artist of neo-expressionism. Basquiat’s
          artwork often contained similar themes and messages about wealth and
          poverty, power and class, as well as how these connect to the black
          community. He brought to light ideas of injustice and inequality in
          relation to African-Americans, often using text in his work, sometimes
          from political or historical documents. Basquiat’s demonization of the
          police is very reflective of the tension between African-Americans and
          the police, especially during the start of the War On Drugs. Police
          brutality and a broken justice system is proof that institutionalized
          racial discrimination lives on.

          Fuck tha Police by N.W.A is a clear representation of the tension that
          exists between the black community and police officers because of the
          continuous unfair treatment, racial profiling, and brutality often
          preformed by the police. The song is extremely confrontational in its

          targeting of young black men. The police officers that are being

          that supports the well-being of for-profit prisons over the safety and

          Kara Walker is among the most complex and prolific American artists of
          her generation. She has gained national and international recognition
          for her cut-paper silhouettes depicting historical narratives haunted
          by sexuality, violence, and subjugation. Walker has also used drawing,
          painting, text, shadow puppetry, film, and sculpture to expose the
          ongoing psychological injury caused by the tragic legacy of slavery.
          Her work leads viewers to a critical understanding of the past while
          also proposing an examination of contemporary racial and gender
          stereotypes.
